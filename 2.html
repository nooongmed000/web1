    </p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy.
      <br>Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared.
      <br>The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles.
      <br>But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!</p>
